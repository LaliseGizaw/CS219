## Programming Information 
This program is designed to open a file, read the text and add the hexadecemials. 
After adding the hexadecimals, it will desplay out the sum. 

## What the program is Using
These are the headers that my program uses.
```#include <iostream>``` This header is for standard input and output
```#include <ifstream>``` I used this header to allow me to File I/O (opening the other files )
```#include <sstream>``` I used this header for stream string 
```#include <cstint>``` I used this header for the unsigned integer to store the hex in it. 
Functions 
I only have one functioon which is the main function
In this function, I opened the file and read the file and added the hexadcimals. 
I also used the same function to output the file.

## Installation 
To run this code, I used VS code. But you can run it on any terminal. As long as it supports cpp

## Running the Program 
Since I only used one function, executing the file is easy. All you have to do is run the following command 
```g++ programming_project1.cpp```
Once the code compiles, run the following command. 
```./a.out programming_project1.txt```
The txt file is whatever txt file you would like to use. When you run the code, it would display the result or give you an error message if the file does not exist.
